			<h2>Towing</h2>
			<p>
	The rapidity and honesty our towing service offers distinguishes us from the rest in the business. 
        Every driver is held responsible for providing superior service at all conditions. 
        <b>F.A.S.T</b> owns several state-of-art towing trucks equipped fully-equipped for any on-road emergency condition. 
        Some of our trucks are equipped with power cranes with an ability of lifting 3.5 tons. 
        All of our trucks are brand new, and are monitored via our GPS system at all times. 
        We cover all areas along the Lebanese territory. 
        Our fleet aims at offering rapid roadside assistance service to local insurance companies' customers, handling more than 50,000 operations per year. 		       
        <br><br>
        We realize if you are calling us for a tow, you are already stressed. 
        You don't need the pressure of wondering if the towing company will do a good job, or where they are towing your vehicle. 
        If your vehicle is towed to our location, it will be placed within our secure lots where it cannot be tampered with. 
        <br><br>
        For roadside assistance services in Lebanon, there is only one name to remember, <b>F.A.S.T !</b>
